RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Briefly, 6-8 week old female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories. RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Briefly, 6-8 week old female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories. RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Briefly, 6-8 week old female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories. RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed.

Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler.

RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) cleanup steps were performed using the Bravo liquid handling platform (Agilent) using a modified version of (Fisher et al., 2011). 120ul SPRI AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) were added to the reverse-crosslinked samples, pipette-mixed 15 times and incubated for 2 minutes. Supernatant were separated from the beads using a 96-well magnet for 4 minutes. Beads were washed on the magnet with 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA was eluted in 40 ul EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) by pipette mixing 25 times. For the remainder of the library construction process (DNA end-repair, A-base addition, adaptor ligation and enrichment) a general SPRI cleanup involves addition of buffer containing 20% PEG and 2.5 M NaCl to the DNA reaction products (without moving them from their original well position). After thorough mixing and a 2-minute incubation at room temperature, plates are transferred to a magnet plate, incubated for 4 minutes and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed on the magnet with 150ul 70% ethanol and then air dried for 4 minutes. The DNA is eluted with 40ul of EB buffer by pipette mixing 25 times. Reagent kits are prepared in advance for all enzymatic steps (New England Biolabs). The DNA end-repair was performed by adding 27 µl of a master mix (17 µl master mix (5 ul T4 buffer, 5ul BSA-1mg/ml, 5ul ATP-10mM -2ul dNTPs 10 mM), 5 ul T4 PNK enzyme, 5 µl T4 polymerase (3 units) to each well. Samples were incubated in a thermal cycler at 12C for 15 min, 25C for 15 min, and finally cooled to 4C. The SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (147 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). The A-base addition was performed by adding 20 µl master mix (17 µl A-base add mix, 3 µl Klenow (3’->5’ exonuclease) to each well and incubated at 37C for 30 min. in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up method was used to purify the product (132 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 19 µl EB). Adaptor ligation was performed by adding 34 µl of a master mix (29 µl 2x DNA ligase buffer, 5 µl DNA ligase) to each well. Finally 5 µl PE Indexed oligo adaptors (0.75 uM ) was added to each well and samples were incubated 25C for 15 min in a thermal cycler. SPRI bead clean up with size selection was used to purify the ligated products (15.5 µl of 20% PEG, 2.5 M NaCl was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl EB). Finally, enrichment PCR was performed by adding 10 µl of a master mix (2 µl Forward/Reverse Index Primer, 0.5 µl dNTP mix, 5 µl 10x Pfu Ultra Buffer, 1 µl Pfu Ultra-II Fusion, 1.5 µl Nuclease free water) to each well. Plate was transferred to a thermal cycler and ran a Pfu amplification program at 95C for 2 min, 16 cycles of: 95C for 30 sec, 55C for 30 sec, 72C for 60 sec, and finally 72C for 10 min. The final SPRI clean up coupled to size selection was performed (35 µl SPRI beads was added to each sample and eluted in 40 µl). Sample concentrations were measured and 5 µl was used for ChIP-String enrichment validation.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was extracted with QIAzol reagent following the miRNeasy kit’s procedure (Qiagen), and sample quality was tested on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). We prepared the RNA-A+-Seq libraries using the ‘dUTP second strand (strand specific) protocol as described in (Levine et al 2010). Briefly, extracts were treated with DNase (Ambion 2238). Polyadenylated RNAs were selected using Ambion's MicroPoly(A)Purist kit (AM1919M) and RNA integrity confirmed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent). RNA was fragmented by incubation in RNA fragmentation buffer (Affymetrix) at 80 degrees for 4 minutes. Fragmented RNA was mixed with 3 μg random hexamers (Invitrogen), incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, and placed on ice briefly before starting cDNA synthesis. We synthesized first-strand cDNA with this RNA primer mix by adding 4 μl 5× first-strand buffer, 2 μl 100 mM DTT, 1 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 4 μg of actinomycin D, 200 U SuperScript III and 20 U SUPERase-In, incubating at room temperature for 10 min followed by 1 h at 55 °C. We synthesized second-strand cDNA by adding 4 μl of 5× first-strand buffer, 2 μl of 100 mM DTT, 4 μl of 10 mM dNTPs with dTTP replaced by dUTP (Sigma), 30 μl of 5× second-strand buffer, 40 U of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, 10 U of E. coli DNA ligase and 2 U of E. coli RNase H, and incubating at 16 °C for 2 h. cDNA was eluted using the Qiagen MiniElute kit with 30 μl of the manufacturer's EB buffer. DNA ends were repaired using dNTPs and T4 polymerase (NEB), followed by purification using the MiniElute kit. Adenine was added to the 3′ end of the DNA fragments using dATP and Klenow exonuclease (NEB; M0212S) to allow adaptor ligation, and fragments were purified using MiniElute. Adaptors were ligated and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (25 °C). Phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Invitrogen 15593-031); extraction followed to remove the DNA ligase. The pellet was then resuspended in 10 μl EB buffer. The sample was run on a 3% agarose gel (Nusieve 3:1 agarose, Lonza) and a 160–380 base pair fragment was cut out and extracted. PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase with the manufacturer's GC buffer (New England Biolabs) and 2 M betaine (Sigma). PCR conditions were 30 s at 98 °C; 16 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 30 s at 72 °C; 5 min at 72 °C; forever at 4 °C. Products were run on a polyacrylamide gel for 60 min at 120 V.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Briefly, 6-8 week old female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories. RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), β-mercaptoethanol (50uM, Invitrogen), L-glutamine (2mM, VWR) penicillin/streptomycin (100U/ml, VWR), MEM non-essential amino acids (1X, VWR), HEPES (10mM, VWR), sodium pyruvate (1mM, VWR), and GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was used throughout the study. At day 0, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were collected from femora and tibiae and plated on twenty (per mouse), 100mm non-tissue culture treated plastic dishes using 10ml medium per plate. At day 2, cells were fed with another 10ml medium per dish. At day 5, cells were harvested from 15ml of the supernatant by spinning at 1400rpm for 5 minutes; pellets were resuspended with 5ml medium and added back to the original dish. Cells were fed with another 5ml medium at day 7.  At Day 8, all non-adherent and loosely bound cells were collected and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended with medium, plated at a concentration of 15x106 cells in 10ml medium per 100mm dish. At day 9, cells were stimulated for various time points with LPS (100ng/ml, rough, ultra-pure E. coli K12 strain, Invitrogen).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Total RNA was extracted with QIAzol reagent following the miRNeasy kit’s procedure (Qiagen), and sample quality was tested on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). We prepared the RNA-A+-Seq libraries using the ‘dUTP second strand (strand specific) protocol as described in (Levine et al 2010). Briefly, extracts were treated with DNase (Ambion 2238). Polyadenylated RNAs were selected using Ambion's MicroPoly(A)Purist kit (AM1919M) and RNA integrity confirmed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent). RNA was fragmented by incubation in RNA fragmentation buffer (Affymetrix) at 80 degrees for 4 minutes. Fragmented RNA was mixed with 3 μg random hexamers (Invitrogen), incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, and placed on ice briefly before starting cDNA synthesis. We synthesized first-strand cDNA with this RNA primer mix by adding 4 μl 5× first-strand buffer, 2 μl 100 mM DTT, 1 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 4 μg of actinomycin D, 200 U SuperScript III and 20 U SUPERase-In, incubating at room temperature for 10 min followed by 1 h at 55 °C. We synthesized second-strand cDNA by adding 4 μl of 5× first-strand buffer, 2 μl of 100 mM DTT, 4 μl of 10 mM dNTPs with dTTP replaced by dUTP (Sigma), 30 μl of 5× second-strand buffer, 40 U of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase, 10 U of E. coli DNA ligase and 2 U of E. coli RNase H, and incubating at 16 °C for 2 h. cDNA was eluted using the Qiagen MiniElute kit with 30 μl of the manufacturer's EB buffer. DNA ends were repaired using dNTPs and T4 polymerase (NEB), followed by purification using the MiniElute kit. Adenine was added to the 3′ end of the DNA fragments using dATP and Klenow exonuclease (NEB; M0212S) to allow adaptor ligation, and fragments were purified using MiniElute. Adaptors were ligated and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (25 °C). Phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Invitrogen 15593-031); extraction followed to remove the DNA ligase. The pellet was then resuspended in 10 μl EB buffer. The sample was run on a 3% agarose gel (Nusieve 3:1 agarose, Lonza) and a 160–380 base pair fragment was cut out and extracted. PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase with the manufacturer's GC buffer (New England Biolabs) and 2 M betaine (Sigma). PCR conditions were 30 s at 98 °C; 16 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 30 s at 72 °C; 5 min at 72 °C; forever at 4 °C. Products were run on a polyacrylamide gel for 60 min at 120 V. The PCR products were cleaned up with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (A63880) to completely remove primers and the product was submitted for Illumina sequencing.
